# WordleProject
This project is a C++ implementation of the Wordle game, where players guess a secret 5-letter word within six attempts. Each guess provides feedback:

Green: Correct letter in the correct position.
Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position.
Red: Letter not in the answer.
Using this feedback, players refine their guesses to either find the word or exhaust all attempts. For example, guessing "LOWER" for the secret word "TOWEL" results in:
L - Yellow, O - Green, W - Green, E - Green, R - Red.

Enjoy guessing and testing your logic!
